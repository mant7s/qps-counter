High-precision QPS (Queries Per Second) statistics system, suitable for real-time request frequency statistics in high-concurrency scenarios. A high-performance counter implemented in Go language, supporting accurate statistics in million-level QPS scenarios.

*[English](README.en.md) | [中文](README.md)*

## ✨ Core Features
- 🚀 Dual-engine architecture (Lock-Free/Sharded), supporting million-level QPS real-time statistics
- 🔄 Intelligent sharding strategy (dynamic sharding based on CPU cores, 10-second interval QPS monitoring)
- ⚡ Time window sliding algorithm (1s window, 100ms precision)
- 🧠 Adaptive load balancing (automatically adjusts when QPS change rate exceeds 30%)
- 🛡️ Enhanced graceful shutdown mechanism (request integrity guarantee, timeout control, forced shutdown)
- 🔒 Token bucket rate limiting (dynamically adjustable rate, burst traffic support, adaptive rate limiting)
- 📊 Prometheus monitoring integration (QPS, memory, CPU, request latency metrics)
- ✅ Health check endpoint support (/healthz)
- 📈 Resource usage monitoring metrics (memory threshold adaptation, automatic shard adjustment)
- ⚙️ High-performance design (atomic operations, fine-grained locks, request counting and statistics)
- 🌐 HTTP server dual-mode support (standard net/http and high-performance fasthttp)

## 🔍 Technical Implementation

### Lock-Free Engine
Lock-free counter based on atomic operations (CAS), suitable for medium traffic scenarios:
- Uses `atomic.Int64` to implement lock-free counting, avoiding lock contention in high concurrency
- Time window sliding algorithm, ensuring statistical accuracy and real-time performance
- Automatic cleaning of expired data to prevent memory leaks

### Sharded Counter
High-performance counter with sharding design, suitable for ultra-high concurrency scenarios:
- Automatic sharding based on CPU cores, default is `runtime.NumCPU() * 4`
- Fine-grained lock design, independent lock for each time slot, maximizing parallelism
- Hash algorithm ensures requests are evenly distributed across shards

### Adaptive Sharding Management
- Real-time monitoring of QPS change rate, triggering shard adjustment when changes exceed ±30%
- Increases shard count by 50% during growth, reduces by 30% during decline
- Shard count range controlled between CPU cores and CPU cores*8, avoiding resource waste
- Memory usage monitoring, automatically adjusts shards when approaching threshold
- Intelligent adjustment based on combined QPS change rate (60%) and memory usage (40%)

### Token Bucket Rate Limiter
- Efficient rate limiting based on token bucket algorithm, supporting burst traffic
- Dynamic rate adjustment to adapt to system load changes
- Adaptive rate limiting mode that automatically adjusts parameters based on system resource usage
- Precise tracking of rejected requests with monitoring metrics

### Monitoring Metrics System
- Prometheus integration providing rich system operational metrics
- Real-time monitoring of QPS, memory usage, CPU utilization, and Goroutine count
- Request latency distribution statistics supporting P99 performance analysis
- Configurable metrics collection interval optimizing performance and precision balance

### Enhanced Graceful Shutdown
- Request integrity guarantee ensuring in-progress requests complete processing
- Multi-level timeout control with soft and hard timeout mechanisms
- Real-time status reporting providing shutdown process observability
- Forced shutdown protection preventing system from hanging indefinitely
